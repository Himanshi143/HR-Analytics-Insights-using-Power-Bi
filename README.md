  - Bar charts for attrition by age group, education field, job role, salary, marital status, and gender.
  - Pie charts to illustrate the distribution of attrition rates across different categories.
- **Analysis**: Key metrics such as total employee count, total attrition, attrition rate, average age, average years of service, and average income were calculated and analyzed.
